### Topic: Clinical Laboratories

### Abstract:
This project will focus on the automation and service optimisation of the clinical laboratory. Receiving patient samples from a doctor and providing the results in an accessible form will be the primary service of our model. We will also integrate supporting processes such as invoicing, testing and sample handling.
